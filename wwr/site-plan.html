This work can include some of the same techniques used by other sports psychologists, such as goal setting, practicing mindfulness, and the use of motivational techniques.

        <h1>Self-motivated for doing sport</h1>
        [Adults (more than 18 years old) are likely to reproduce the habits that they acquired
        during childhood and adolescence (from 6 to 16 years old). For that reason, teachers 
        and parents have the responsibility to promote an active and healthy lifestyle in 
        children and adolescents. Even though every school subject should promote healthy 
        activities, Physical Education (PE) is the most important subject to foster well-being 
        habits associated to healthy lifestyle during sport practice and other kinds of active 
        tasks. Indeed, there are many factors that influence the acquisition of healthy habits 
        that should be taken into account when programs and activities are implemented in both 
        educational and extracurricular context. In this sense, psychological and social factors 
        are of utmost importance to achieve optimal experiences for an active and healthy 
        lifestyle.]
