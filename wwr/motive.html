    <h1>This is some helpful information for knowing more about sport and it's important in life which can inspire people to do it daily. </h1>
    <h3> Adults (more than 18 years old) are likely to reproduce the habits that they acquired
         during childhood and adolescence (from 6 to 16 years old). For that reason, teachers 
         and parents have the responsibility to promote an active and healthy lifestyle in 
         children and adolescents. Even though every school subject should promote healthy 
         activities, Physical Education (PE) is the most important subject to foster well-being 
         habits associated to healthy lifestyle during sport practice and other kinds of active 
         tasks. Indeed, there are many factors that influence the acquisition of healthy habits 
         that should be taken into account when programs and activities are implemented in both 
         educational and extracurricular context. In this sense, psychological and social factors 
         are of utmost importance to achieve optimal experiences for an active and healthy 
         lifestyle.</h3>
         
         <h3>However, due to the myriad of studies analyzing different factors in different
    contexts, there could be confusion when programs and pedagogical strategies are applied
    in educational or extracurricular contexts. The objective of this investigation is to
    analyse the state of art of the psychosocial factors which influence the engagement
    in physical activities and sport practice. The keywords used in this review were 
    mainly: “Self-Determination Theory,” “(intrinsic) motivation,” “Psychological need 
    satisfaction,” “physical activity and sport engagement,” “Elementary Education,” 
    “Secondary Education,” “Physical Education.” In addition, the Boolean data type 
    “and,” “or,” and “not” were also used. The articles were selected according to the
    following criteria: (a) peer-reviewed original research published in international 
    journals indexed in JCR or SJR, (b) published in English or Spanish, (c) about 
    psychosocial factors which influence the physical activity and sport engagement,
    (d) in educational or extracurricular context. Research articles selected were
     found through Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, SportDiscus (EBSCO-host),
     ERIC, PubMed, Medline, and PsycInfo databases.<br></h3>
                 
    <h3> It was observed that physical
    activities and sport practice engagement are closely related to psychological 
    factors. In particularly, intrinsic motivation was able to determine the active
    participation in any activity, including physical activity and sport practice
    during the implementation of Small-Sided Games and other kinds of pedagogical 
    strategies (e.g., Pedagogical Models). Motivation was also closely related to 
    flow state. Finally, these variables should be considered in order to organize 
    effective programs to promote an active and healthy lifestyle in Physical Education classes.</h3>

    <h2>HOW DOES SELF-MOTIVATION BENEFIT SPORTS PERFORMANCE?</h2>
    <h3>The best thing about self-motivation is you can take it with you anywhere and use it at 
     any time. It’s your inner voice and one of the best things to use when training, during a sports
     match or to gear yourself up before facing a challenge. It’s easier said than done at times, 
     particularly if you aren’t seeing any visible successes or other areas of your life are interfering
     in your energy levels. Optimal self-motivation leads to taking that leap, having a go, challenging 
     yourself, and ultimately contributes to a better sports performance where you are sustaining 
     a high-quality engagement while playing.</h3> 
     
     <h2>BENEFITS OF MOTIVATION ON SPORTS PERFORMANCE</h2>
    <h3>
        The first thing is that nobody’s perfect! Performing to the best of your ability and challenging
         yourself each time is tough. The results are often not seen until months or even years of 
         training have taken place. It can be difficult for anyone to stay motivated in the long-term, 
         particularly if they are training solo and have nobody to make them accountable. That’s just 
         one example of when motivating coaches and sports motivational speakers can step in.
        
        Motivation is an essential part of sports performance. Self-motivation and extrinsic motivation 
        combined together form the best kind of motivation and encourage goal setting and working hard
         to reach that goal.3</h3>
