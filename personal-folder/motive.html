    <h1>This is some helpful information for knowing more about sport and it's important in life</h1>
    <h2 style="background-color: aquamarine;">Adults (more than 18 years old) are likely to reproduce the habits that they acquired
         during childhood and adolescence (from 6 to 16 years old). For that reason, teachers 
         and parents have the responsibility to promote an active and healthy lifestyle in 
         children and adolescents. Even though every school subject should promote healthy 
         activities, Physical Education (PE) is the most important subject to foster well-being 
         habits associated to healthy lifestyle during sport practice and other kinds of active 
         tasks. Indeed, there are many factors that influence the acquisition of healthy habits 
         that should be taken into account when programs and activities are implemented in both 
         educational and extracurricular context. In this sense, psychological and social factors 
         are of utmost importance to achieve optimal experiences for an active and healthy 
         lifestyle.<br>
         
         <h2>However, due to the myriad of studies analyzing different factors in different
          contexts, there could be confusion when programs and pedagogical strategies are applied
           in educational or extracurricular contexts. The objective of this investigation is to
            analyse the state of art of the psychosocial factors which influence the engagement
             in physical activities and sport practice. The keywords used in this review were 
             mainly: “Self-Determination Theory,” “(intrinsic) motivation,” “Psychological need 
             satisfaction,” “physical activity and sport engagement,” “Elementary Education,” 
             “Secondary Education,” “Physical Education.” In addition, the Boolean data type 
             “and,” “or,” and “not” were also used. The articles were selected according to the
              following criteria: (a) peer-reviewed original research published in international 
              journals indexed in JCR or SJR, (b) published in English or Spanish, (c) about 
              psychosocial factors which influence the physical activity and sport engagement,
               (d) in educational or extracurricular context. Research articles selected were
                found through Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, SportDiscus (EBSCO-host),
                 ERIC, PubMed, Medline, and PsycInfo databases.<br></h2>
                 
                <h2> It was observed that physical
                  activities and sport practice engagement are closely related to psychological 
                  factors. In particularly, intrinsic motivation was able to determine the active
                   participation in any activity, including physical activity and sport practice
                    during the implementation of Small-Sided Games and other kinds of pedagogical 
                    strategies (e.g., Pedagogical Models). Motivation was also closely related to 
                    flow state. Finally, these variables should be considered in order to organize 
                    effective programs to promote an active and healthy lifestyle in Physical Education classes.</h2>
